    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to introduce the idea of growth rates of infinite sequences. Recall that an infinite sequence is an ordered collection of points and is denoted $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$, where $a_n$ can be defined **recursively** as in the famous Fibonacci sequence $a_n = a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$ (leading to the sequence $\\{1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\\ldots\\}$) or **explicitly** as in $a_n=\\frac1n$ (leading to the Harmonic sequence $\\left\\{1,\\frac12,\\frac13,\\frac14,\\frac15,\\ldots\\right\\}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have two infinte sequences $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ and $\\{b_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$, for example, $a_n = 100n$ and $b_n = n^2$. One question we might ask is: \"Which is larger: $\\{100n\\}$ or $\\{n^2\\}$?\" For a fixed $n$ this is easy to answer: $a_1 > b_1$, $a_2 > b_2$, and so on until $a_{10}=b_{10}$, $a_{11}<b_{11}$, and so on. The fact that the inequality flips at $n=10$ means that the question \"which sequence is larger\" in this pointwise-sense does not really make sense. In general there is no reason to believe that an ordering $a_n > b_n$ will be true for all $n$ (or vice versa). \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was with focusing on the *value* of each term in the sequences. Instead we want to consider the **growth rate** of the terms. So, in my example, $\\{b_n\\}$ has a faster growth rate than $\\{a_n\\}$ (denoted by $\\{100n\\} << \\{n^2\\}$) since once $b_n = n^2$ overtakes $a_n = 100n$ (at $n=10$), $a_n$ will never catch up again. We denote the fact that $b_n$ has a faster growth rate than $a_n$ by writing .\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook we're specifically interested in the relative growth rates of the following important sequences: $\\{\\ln^q n\\}$, $\\{n^p\\}$, $\\{n^{p+s}\\ln^r n\\}$, $\\{b^n\\}$, $\\{n!\\}$, and $\\{n^n\\}$ where $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s>0$ and $b>1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Set-up\n",
    "The simulations in this notebook rely on Python code. To initialize the notebook select **Cell->Run All Below**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the simulation below to try to determine the relative growth rates of each of the sequences. I recommend that you only investigate at most three at a time. The initial settings are pretty good but you'll want to keep the following things in mind as you experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\ln n < n$ for all integers $n$ and so it is always true that $\\ln^q n < n^p$ whenever $q\\le p$. Therefore you will want to specifically investigate whether or not this relationship remains true for $q>p$\n",
    "- For a similar reason when comparing $n^p\\ln^r n$ with $n^{p+s}$ we really only need to study $r>s$ (in fact, this case is the exact same as comparing $\\ln^r$ with $n^s$ once you factor our $n^p$)\n",
    "- For $b$ large and $p$ small you should be able to convince yourself at $b^n>n^p$ for all $n$ (try for example $b=1000$ and $p=1$). Therefore, in comparing $b^n$ and $n^p$ we only need to test the relative growth rates for $b$ very **close to 1** and $p$ large.\n",
    "- For $b$ close to 1 you should be able to convince yourself that $b^n<n!$ and $b^n<n^n$ (try for example $b=2$; then these relationships are true for all $n\\ge4$). Therefore, in comparing $b^n$ with $n!$ and $n^n$ we only need to test what happens for $b$ very **large**\n",
    "- In all cases make sure that the relationship you observe remains true for as you increase $n$. For many choices of $q$, $p$, $r$, $s$, and $b$ it is possible that you will not observe the true growth rate relationship until $n$ gets very, very large. This is why in practice mathematicians use limits (see the **Final Comments** section below)."

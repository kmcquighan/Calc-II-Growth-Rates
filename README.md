# Calc-II-Growth-Rates
The purpose of this Notebook is to explain what is meant by the "growth rate" of an infinite sequence. You can run experiments on the growth rate of various important sequences like ln n, n^p, b^n, n! and n^n. 

You can either download the files and run the Notebook on your local machine or you can launch the Notebook by clicking on the mybinder.org link below.

# Calc-II-Growth-Rates
The purpose of this Notebook is to explain what is meant by the "growth rate" of an infinite sequence. You can run experiments on the growth rate of various important sequences like ln n, n^p, b^n, n! and n^n. 

You can either download the files and run the Notebook on your local machine or you can launch the Notebook by clicking on the mybinder.org link below.

Note: the mybinder.org servers are not always running. If you're having difficulty launching the notebook please check the status of the servers at http://mybinder.org/status

If you download the files to your computer make sure that you have the GrowthRateTools.py file: these are the backend functions that create the simulations in the notebook.
